----- General Structure -----

DEFINE Valid choices for game
DEFINE rules for winning (in a hash?)

GETS input from player
  VALIDATE from only valid choices
COMPARE input from player with computer
  SAMPLE from valid choices

DISPLAY result (who won?)
GETS input (do you want to play again?)

----- Steps to modify code -----

APPEND 'lizard' and 'spock' string to valid_choices 

INIT a hash containing all valid choices and the moves they will win against
  ex. choices_and_winning_moves = {"rock" => ['scissors', 'lizard'] etc
  
MODIFY def_win?(first, second)
  if hash['first'].include?('second')
end
